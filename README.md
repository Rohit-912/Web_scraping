# ðŸ“° **Web Article Scraper â€“ The Hindu**

This Python script scrapes the main content from a *The Hindu* news article and saves it to a local text file.

---

## ðŸ“Œ **Features**
- Sends an HTTP request with a custom `User-Agent` to avoid blocking.
- Parses HTML using **BeautifulSoup**.
- Extracts only the main article content by skipping irrelevant sections.
- Optionally wraps text for better readability.
- Saves the extracted text to `scraped.txt`.

## ðŸ“‚ **How It Works**
1. **Fetch Webpage** â€“ Uses `requests` to download the HTML content.
2. **Parse HTML** â€“ Uses `BeautifulSoup` to extract paragraph (`<p>`) tags.
3. **Filter Content** â€“ Selects the relevant slice of paragraphs (`paragraphs[9:-5]`).
4. **Format & Save** â€“ Joins the text and writes it to a `.txt` file.
